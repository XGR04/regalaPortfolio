            </a>
            <h4><p>Artemisia Gentileschi, the renowned Italian painter of the seventeenth century.
                My admiration for Renaissance masterpieces led me to discover her. Her paintings 
                are particularly captivating, skillfully conveying raw emotions while harboring a 
                dark and intriguing backstory. My exposure during art history had primarily been 
                to male artists. However, Artemisia's brilliance has provided a refreshing 
                perspective, possibly also because I am slightly biased. The recognition of her 
                skills and the acknowledgment of a woman's contribution to the art world drew me 
                towards her work.
                </p>
                <p>I am essentially just drawn to the older techniques of classical painting, 
                appreciating the meticulous and unhurried process that creates masterpieces. 
                The allure of ethereal and occasionally intense chiaroscuro further deepens my 
                admiration for the artistry involved.
                </p>
                <p>In contrast to the more traditional styles, I've found myself less inclined 
                towards modern art. Perhaps it's due to a lack of understanding or a challenge in 
                grasping the "why" behind certain modern art styles. However, I remain open-minded 
                and am willing to explore art beyond its physical elements, understanding the 
                layers of meaning and intention in the works.

            <a href="https://www.vqpalette.com/"><h3>v? "Vanessa"</h3>
                <img src="img/VPainter.jpg" alt="Pixie Dust">
            </a>
            <h4><p>Ironically, despite my usual preference for more traditional art forms, I find immense 
                inspiration in the works of a contemporary artist. Vanessa, known as "V?" in the art world, 
                i found through Instagram, and from the moment I encountered her work, I was captivated. 
                Typically, I wouldn't be drawn to such contemporary pieces, yet there's an inexplicable 
                allure to Vanessa's artistry. Her paintings resonate with me profoundlyâ€”perhaps it's the 
                vibrant explosion of color or the meticulous yet seemingly effortless application of clear 
                strokes. 
                </p>
                <p>Each brushstroke carries a sense of purpose and intention, inviting viewers to lose 
                themselves in the layers of her artistry. While her compositions may appear chaotic at first 
                glance, there's an underlying harmony that exudes a profound sense of calm amidst the energy 
                and vibrancy of her creations. It's like her creations are of a magical forest, ethereal like 
                the Renaissance paintings, but in a more inviting way.
                </p>
                <p>Vanessa's work has challenged my perceptions and opened my eyes to the limitless 
                possibilities of artistic expression, despite my initial misgivings about modern art. She is 
                essentially a continual reminder that genuine inspiration transcends genres and tastes and 
                reaches the brains and hearts of those who are willing to venture.
